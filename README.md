# IncrementalRPG

## NEW VERSION - As of March 2018!
I have rebuilt the game from the ground up. It will now be much easier to add to the game as the code is much DRYer and separated into multiple js files.

Incremental Game with the goal of growing and growing as much as possible.

## To Do
- [ ] Remove all static information from the localStorage files. We don't need to save resource names, descriptions, etc on the user's computer. We only need to save the user specific data.
- [ ] Update to bootstrap 4 or remove bootstrap all together and make it all bespoke. (We could remove jQuery then too.)
- [ ] Better message display. Popup notifications?
- [ ] Better upgrade display? Do we need to show what upgrades have been purchased?
